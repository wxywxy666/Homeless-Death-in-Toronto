# Investigating the Cause of Homeless People's Deaths in Toronto

> ## title

This repository contains a paper investigating basic information on homeless deaths in Toronto from 2017 to 2023. From this, we can learn the year, cause, age, gender and number of their deaths. Of course, some information is still unknown due to uncontrollable factors and will not be discussed in detail here. What I want to study is how we can gain a deeper understanding of this group from this information, pay attention to the potential impact of the epidemic on them, and what suggestions can be made to improve this social problem. The data used in this paper can be found in the Open Data Portal of Toronto.
